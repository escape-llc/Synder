    <outline text="A vocation in dance music that spans a decade; an unprecedented reputation as
a highly accomplished and distinctive producer coupled with a DJ ability to
match; Ali Wilson is a name that is synonymous to Trance with DJs, Producers
and clubbers alike. As a versatile artist, he defies conforming to the
consensus; finding inspiration from every corner of the musical spectrum
providing for a fresh approach to dance music. His sound is unique and his
technical ability unparalleled, which immediately differentiates him from the
masses. From a young age Mixmag proclaimed Ali as one of the �TOP 5 Young DJ�s
to watch worldwide� alongside Nic Fanculii and Montana. This was further
cemented when he received an award as a �MixMag Future Hero�. Carl Cox named
him as one of his �producers of 2006� in the DJ Mag Top 100 Poll and Judge
Jules featured him as his �Top Tip for 2008�. Since this, Ali has gone on to
prove them to be to be right. Ali�s productions now feature in every Trance
DJ�s sets, he has toured worldwide and worked with some of the most prevalent
artists and companies in the industry and has been a regular appearance on the
biggest dance radio shows. Ali DJs alongside many of the industry primes
including Armin, Tiesto (asked to play on his kaleidoscope tour), Ferry
Corsten, Gareth Emery, Sander van Doorn, Judge Jules and Marco V and has
played some of the largest events across the globe such as the Sunrise
Festival, Trance Energy and Judgement Sunday. Ali also plays regularly in
Ibiza, Poland, Russia, USA, Asia, Cyprus and all over the UK. With over 400
productions under his belt his productions have featured on some of the top
labels in the world including Sony, Warner, Armada, Blackhole, Spinnin,
Toolroom, Doorn, Ali�s own label Tekelec and having released his album on
Dutch heavyweight Be Yourself (Incharge/High Contrast). This musical aptitude
has gained the attention of the media majors with Warner requesting his skills
to remix various works for the internationally acclaimed, chart hitting
singer/songwriter �Little Boots�. This has lead to further remix
collaborations with some of the industry giants such as Tiesto, Bloc Party and
Armin Van Buuren. Ali�s bootlegs of Coldplay�s �Fix You�, Kings of Leon�s �Use
somebody� and the latest Lana Del Rey � Videgames have even become legendary
throughout club land with that midas touch it guarantees to set any dance
floor alight. Ali�s 16-track-strong, genre-dissolving prodigy artist album
'Phenomenon' was released towards the end of 2010, and features the dance
chart topping �Pandora�, which was tune of the week on ASOT 443, �Pandora�
also featured as one of the top 10 tracks of 2010 for Armin. The album has
already received patronage on Armin�s ASOT , BBC radio 1, and was further
supported by the likes of Ferry Corsten and Gareth Emery. Ali has also just
mixed... High Contrast Recordings Presents Ali Wilson... which is a 31-track
mix comp, purposefully and skillfully mixed to chip away at dance music�s
stylistic borders. Lovers of Cox, Jules, Van Buuren, Prydz and a dozen other
eclectic DJs will find plenty of audio to enjoy. Listen without prejudice
(Quote from Tim Stark). With lots of brand new singles and remixes ready to go
Ali Wilson is one DJ that is set to push the scene forward with his innovative
and diverse approach to production and DJing, summer festivals are already
locked down and an album tour is planned throughout the year�� Quotes: Judge
Jules (BBC Radio 1): �Ali Wilson was one I tipped for big things and he�s
certainly delivered.� Armin Van Buuren: �Pandora is off the hook!!!!!!! I play
it in every set and every time the roof goes off!!!� MIXMAG: �Ali Wilson is
looking to be one of the success stories having being added as one of Tiesto�s
support acts at resent shows!� Ferry Corsten: �Just a message quickly to say
that I love most of your new tracks. Been playing them A LOT!!!!! Awesome
work!� Carl Cox �Right now Ali cannot put a foot wrong�." title="Ali Wilson TEKELEC Sessions" type="rss" xmlUrl="http://andski.net/tekelec/tekelec.xml"/>
