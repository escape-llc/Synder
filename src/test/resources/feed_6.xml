But he’s not after sunken treasure--he’s after information. Foley is a marine archeologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He’s taking a new approach to the field. Instead of just focusing on a handful of shipwrecks, he wants to take a broad look, finding and cataloging wrecks  in the Mediterranean that date to a wide timeframe. In this podcast, he talks to us about his work.

<item><title>Stuck on Mars</title><description>NASA’s twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have been exploring the surface of Mars for more than six years. It’s an impressive fact, considering they were only designed to last for three months. But despite this longevity, recent mechanical failures have brought the Spirit rover to a standstill. In this podcast, we talked to Bruce Banerdt, the Project Scientist for the Mars rover missions, about the fate of this now-stationary rover.

<item><title>The Littlest Planet</title><description>In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided on new definition of a planet--and Pluto didn’t make the grade. It was bumped down to “dwarf planet” status. But it’s not alone. It’s now one of five known dwarf planets in the solar system. One of them, called Ceres, may hold clues to how life formed on Earth. In this podcast, we talked to planetary scientist Mark Sykes about this tiny world.

<item><title>In Defense of Pluto</title><description>After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it enjoyed the title of planet for more than 75 years. But in 2006, that all changed. At a meeting in Prague, the International Astronomical Union adopted a new definition for planethood, leaving the solar system with only eight planets. But not everyone agrees with its decision. In this podcast, planetary scientist Alan Stern talks to us about Pluto’s demotion, and why he thinks it should be back on list of planets.

<item><title>Diving Into Danger</title><description>Scientists are excited about the Bahamas, and it’s not just the tropical vacations that have their interest. It’s what’s underneath the surface of the islands—huge caves systems filled with water. They’re called blue holes, and deep inside of them lie clues to past climate change, new species of invertebrates, even human remains from people who lived on the islands long before Columbus visited. In this podcast, hear from Kenny Broad, a researcher who led a diving expedition into blue holes last year.

<item><title>Capturing Darwin's Dilemma</title><description>In 1862, Charles Darwin faced his greatest dilemma-whether or not to go public with his incendiary theory of evolution. It was a turning point for him, and for science as a whole. Today, scriptwriter John Goldsmith, former head of the British Writer's Guild, has crafted the story into a two-hour special for NOVA.  In this interview, he talked to NOVA's Susan Lewis about the challenges of making of the film, and his fascination with the Darwin family.

Podcast produced by David Levin. Interview by Susan Lewis. NOVA is produced by WGBH in Boston. Funding for NOVA is provided by ExxonMobil, David H. Koch, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and public television viewers.
